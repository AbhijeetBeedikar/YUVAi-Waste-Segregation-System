# YUVAi-Waste-Segregation-System
The AI Waste Segregation System is a software that can classify waste and aid in their segregation. It processes real time data, draws bounding boxes around each waste item and classifies it accordingly. When integrated with hardware, these bounding boxes can allow machines to sort waste with greater efficiency.
